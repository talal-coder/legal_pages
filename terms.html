      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms govern your use of our services, including responding to rental inquiries, coordinating showings,
        and providing application-related information (collectively, the “Services”). By using our website or contacting us
        directly, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="https://pharoan.com/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How Our Services Work</h2>
      <p>
        We provide real estate services related to rental properties, including responding to inquiries, scheduling tours,
        and providing application information. You may contact us through third-party platforms, our website, or directly
        by phone, email, or text message. Communications are limited to responding to inquiries and related customer care activities.
      </p>

      <h2>3. SMS and Email Communications</h2>
      <p>
        We may communicate with you by phone, email, or SMS in response to inquiries you initiate. SMS messages are sent only
        for customer care purposes, such as responding to questions, coordinating tours, and providing application-related information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we initiate SMS communication in the future for purposes beyond responding to a user-initiated inquiry, we will obtain
        explicit consent prior to sending messages. Message frequency varies based on the nature of the inquiry. Message and data rates may apply.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        You may opt out of SMS communications at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>. Reply <strong>HELP</strong> for assistance.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to misuse our listings, website, or communications, including submitting false information or using our content for resale,
        spam, or automated scraping. Property listings and information are provided “as is” and may change without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All photos, content, and materials on our website or in our communications belong to us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify,
        or redistribute any part of our materials without prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee that every property detail is error-free. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
        we are not liable for losses or damages resulting from your use of the Services. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction is to stop using them.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Updates to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms periodically. Updated versions will be posted here with an updated “Last Updated” date.
        Continued use of the Services after changes means you accept the revised Terms.
      </p>
